# MVC-cshaw

Link to Heroku site:
https://calm-basin-00430.herokuapp.com/

This project was structured with an MVC format. You will find models, views and controllers separated so that the functions are easily understood. 

This site uses handlebars.js to create a lighter load time for JS logic and data. I used Sequelize to handle the data and CRUD methods that users do. 
Express.js is used for the routing.
